                <h5> <span className='text-danger'>Answer:   </span>
                    To validate React props using PropTypes, you can import the PropTypes library and define the expected type and shape of the props in the component's propTypes object. For example, if you want to ensure that a prop called "name" is a string, you can write:

                    <br /> In this example, the name prop is defined as a required string using the isRequired method. If a prop of a different type or shape is passed to the component, a warning will be logged in the console. This can help catch errors early in the development process and make it easier to debug your code.

                    Difference between Node.js and Express.js:

                    <br />Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript.
                    Express. js is a framework based on Node.js which is used for building web-application using approaches and principles of Node.js event-driven architecture.

                <h5> <span className='text-danger'>Answer:   </span>
                    In React, a custom hook is a function that uses other built-in hooks and allows you to extract and reuse logic in functional components. Custom hooks follow the naming convention of starting with the word "use" and can be shared across components, reducing code duplication and improving reusability.

                    You might create a custom hook to encapsulate some common logic or behavior that can be shared across different components. This can help to make your code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. For example, if you find yourself using a similar set of hooks and logic in multiple components, you could create a custom hook to abstract away that logic and make it easier to reuse in different parts of your application.
